# HR Analytics Dashboard

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
In this project, I used **Power BI** to create an interactive **HR Analytics Dashboard** that helps organizations track and analyze their workforce.  
The dashboard provides insights into employee demographics, performance, attrition, and satisfaction levels, enabling data-driven HR decisions.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
The dataset contains employee information including:
- Demographics (age, gender, marital status, ethnicity)  
- Employment details (department, job role, tenure, business travel, overtime)  
- Performance metrics (satisfaction levels, ratings, work-life balance)  
- Attrition (active vs. inactive employees, attrition rate)

- **Star Schema** with fact and dimension tables:  
  - FactPerformanceRating (performance, satisfaction, ratings)  
  - DimEmployee (employee info: age, department, travel, etc.)  
  - DimDate (hire date, attrition date, etc.)  
  - DimRatingLevel (rating categories)

This structured model ensures efficient queries, easy DAX calculations, and scalable reporting.
